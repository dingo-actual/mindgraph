# Testing Best Practices

1. Test One Thing - Each test should verify a single behavior or property, making failures unambiguous and tests easier to understand, maintain, and debug.

2. Arrange-Act-Assert Pattern - Structure tests with clear setup, execution, and verification phases to improve readability and ensure consistent test organization across the codebase.

3. Test at Multiple Granularities - Combine unit tests for components, integration tests for interactions, and system tests for end-to-end behavior to achieve comprehensive coverage.

4. Make Tests Deterministic - Eliminate randomness, timing dependencies, and external state to ensure tests produce consistent results and failures can be reliably reproduced.

5. Test Boundaries and Edge Cases - Focus on input boundaries, empty collections, null values, and extreme conditions where bugs commonly hide and assumptions break down.

6. Keep Tests Fast - Optimize test execution speed to encourage frequent running, enabling rapid feedback cycles and maintaining developer productivity throughout the development process.

7. Tests as Living Documentation - Write descriptive test names and clear assertions that document expected behavior, serving as executable specifications for your codebase.

8. Isolate Dependencies - Use mocks, stubs, or fakes to isolate units under test from external dependencies, ensuring tests remain focused and failures indicate specific problems.

9. Test Early and Continuously - Integrate testing throughout development rather than as an afterthought, catching issues when they're cheapest and easiest to fix.

10. Maintain Test Quality - Apply the same engineering standards to test code as production code, including refactoring, code review, and avoiding duplication.

11. Verify Negative Cases - Test error handling, invalid inputs, and failure scenarios to ensure the system degrades gracefully and provides meaningful feedback when things go wrong.

12. Balance Coverage and Value - Focus testing effort on critical paths, complex logic, and high-risk areas rather than pursuing arbitrary coverage metrics.
